Diagnosis of Takotsubo Syndrome by Robust Feature Selection from the Complex Latent Space of DL-Based Segmentation Network

## Description
This repository presents a novel diagnostic pipeline for Takotsubo Syndrome (TTS) using robust feature selection from the latent space of a deep learning-based echocardiogram segmentation model. By leveraging LASSO-based selection on latent features, the method achieves 82% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming previous SOTA approaches in distinguishing TTS from STEMI. The project demonstrates the potential of latent space analysis for differential diagnosis and long-term prognostic modeling in cardiac imaging.
